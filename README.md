# Customer Churn Project-Machine-Learning
<h1>A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT CUSTOMER CHURN</h1>



Over time, the customer churn rate has posed a significant threat to ConnectTel's  business stability, and growth, The company's current customer retention strategies lack precision and
effectiveness, resulting in the loss of valuable customers to competitors. The identification of the causes of customer churn  relies heavily on statistical and machine-learning approaches, which I have been tasked to carry out.
<h2>Objectives
</h2>
<li>Accurately forecast customer churn.</li>
<li>Implement targeted retention policies</li>
<li>Enhance cusotmer loyalty</li>
<li>Device means or methods to maintain a competitive edge</li>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
The dataset contains more "No" values under the churn column than "Yes" which implies an imbalance in the dataset, which could lead to a biased model performance.
<h3>Tools Used</h3>
Jupyter Notebook and multiple Python libraries.
<h3>Task Performed</h3>
EDA (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis)

Data Preprocessing (Feature engineering, Encoding, Scaling)

Model Building (Splitting, Training Model evaluation, Pipeline model, Tunning model, fit model)
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
After comparing several models, The logistic regression model provided an Accuracy of 0.8065% rate that a customer will churn.
